# DigiKonSphere - AI + IoT Artisan Marketplace

## Project Overview
DigiKonSphere is an **AI and IoT-powered marketplace** connecting traditional artisans with global buyers. It aims to **empower artisans, preserve cultural heritage**, and provide buyers with an **interactive and immersive shopping experience**. The platform combines **AI-driven marketing**, **AR/3D product previews**, and a **physical IoT showcase**

## Prototype
This repository contains a **Figma prototype** of the solution. The prototype demonstrates key workflows including:
- ** Prototype Link:** [https://citron-trade-43110342.figma.site/]
- Artisan product upload with optional **AI story/video generation**
- Buyer browsing via web/VR or IoT TFT LCD
- AR/3D product preview
- Order placement with **IoT showcase box simulation** (LED & TFT display)
- Buyer profile and **order history**
- **Multi-language support** (English, Hindi, and other regional languages for rural artisans)

## Key Features
- **Artisan Dashboard:** Upload products, set prices, manage inventory, generate AI stories/videos.
- **Buyer Marketplace:** Browse products, view AR/3D previews, place orders, and view order history.
